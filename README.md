# WG4_Uncertainty_training

This is the code and data base for a course on uncertainty, calibration and traceability held on Romania at CETAL in fall 2019.


The structure and content is as follows:

- Schedule and Presentations: Includes the course schedule and the presentation that are explaining the tasks that are then implemented in the Matlab code.
- ExampleData: Data used by the provided Matlab code
- Matlab Code: Example Matlab code, covering the example and exercises of this training school

Matlab function details, data and relevant presentations follow below.

| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| L_Sphere.mat												| Input file for the code: radiance levels of the integrating sphere
| STD_DN.mat												| Input file for the code: noise of the DN measurements, given as standard deviation
| DN_L_CAL.mat												| Input file for the code: DN levels of the instrument as exposed to integrating sphere at different light levels
| uL.mat												    | Input file for the code: uncertainty of the radiance calibration of the sphere (given at confidence interval of k=2)
| u_rad_coeffs.mat											| Output of Monte Carlo run: uncertainties of gain, offset and uncertainty due to gain and offset correlation. This file is eventually generated by the code itself.

| MC_Introduction.m											| Code to produce plots shown in the intro to Monte Carlo presentation
| RAD_CAL_with_Linear_Fit_and_uncertainty_estimation_with_Monte_Carlo.m | Main script. Note: set the run_sim = true on line 408 to run MC (This can take very long! You may want initially to choose a lower number of realisations by e.g. setting N = 10 on line 282). Set to false once you have them calculated.
| print_jpeg.m print_pdf.m		| Functions to export figure to JPEG or PDF
| progressbar.m, gui_active.m		| Functions for progress bar used to show progress during monte carlo run
| get_realisations_gauss_dist.m	| Function to create realisations
